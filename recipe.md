** For outer Layer **

Knead the maida |all purpose flour into a pliable dough.Add salt and oil while kneading. Keep this covered for 15 minutes.
Make the dough into 4 equal portions .  Roll each portion of the dough like a roti.
In a rolling board place one rolled roti and spread little oil on this and sprinkle generously with maida | all purpose flour.
spread it nicely and stack on other roti and do the same process of applying oil and sprinkling flour and stack other roti on this. Repeat this for the four rotis.

** samosa **

** making of samosa sheets **
Roll this again into thin rotis. If you want you can dust this with flour too. roll them into a big circle.
Heat a pan and carefully place the stacked and thinly rolled maida roti . When it becomes warm on one side turn it carefully. do not over cook. even no need to cook till spots come. Let it become white itself.

 Carefully take out one sheet. ( you could easily take out after few minutes) Slowly you can take out 4 sheets. the outer layer for samosa are ready.
Stack the sheets on the rolling board.

Cut them into four halves as shown in the picture below.
Now the cut sheets are ready to make samosas. Actually these are the spring roll sheets which you can use for making spring rolls.
Make a paste of maida with little water in a small bowl. this is to seal the edges of the  samosas.
Add the maida paste at the bottom edge (semi circle portion) of the one sheet.
Bring both the edges to center.
It will be like a cone.
Add the filling (about 1-2 tblsp) inside the cone .


Bring the edge to the bottom side of the cone and seal this with maida paste.

Repeat this for all the samosas. the filling i made i managed to use for all the 12 samosas.
You can put in it in a ziplock cover and freeze it and fry it whenever you want.
When frying keep oil in a pan and deep fry the samosa in a medium flame till it becomes golden brown on both sides. Drain it in a kitchen towel.

Hot samosas are ready to serve. Enjoy with coffee | tea.

Notes:
You can choose the filling of your  choice.
Do not attempt with whole wheat flour as it will not come out crispy.
